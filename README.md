# Angular2Assign
## The Hero Dashboard

This assignment was completed as an introduction to Angular 2.0 following the tutorial found at [angular.io](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/) for the DGM 3780 class.

###Build Instructions

After cloning the repo, open the command line inside the repo root and type

```
npm install
```

Once node has completed it's installation simply run

```
npm start
```

The application will launch a browser window with the proper view.

###What I have learned

I am not new to the world of Angular.js although this is my first time working with version 2.0 and I find that its strucure is quite different from 1.x and I like the fact that it is much more simple on its surface

###What I found dificult

I found it dificult to not stick things in different folders, and have it all in just the app folder. I like to separate my code much as the soldier from the movie Toys likes to separate his food... I will be looking at the code and seeing if I can manipulate it to further change that to my liking

###Why are .gitignore files important
I have included a .gitignore file in this repo for the purpose of simplifying the colaborative effort. In a compiled application, only the base files and folders neccessary to build the app need to be shared. The individual developers may then have a small and easy to deploy package. This also provides a modicum of filtering for the colaboration. If someone wants to suggest changes then they need to be able to understand the underlying architecture of the app before sticking their nose in. I realize this may sound snobish but really... it helps to keep things clean and progressive.
